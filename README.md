The small project is created to understand neural network structure

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset/data#

The problem is the binary classification of horses and humans. The image data is preprocessed and the simple neural network structure is written from scratch to learn the forward propagation and the backpropagation.
